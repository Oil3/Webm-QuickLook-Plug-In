 Revise README for version 2.5 release

###



## Install  
>Launch the app once. This registers the extension as the extension itself stays within the app bundle.  

## Uninstall  
>Delete the app.  

## Update  
>Replace the older app with the newer app.  MacOS looks for the extension in the app: if app is moved, a relaunch might be needed.  Best to keep in `Macintosh HD/Applications`.    


Works on all macOSX versions (Big Sur to latest Sequoia) and all Silicon or Intel mac architectures.
