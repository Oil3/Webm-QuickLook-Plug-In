# Webm QuickLook Plug-In extension  
  

An extension for MacOS' "QuickLook" which allows .webm movies to be played in the Finder and Spotlight previews like any other movies.
  
Choice of "autoplay" and "no-autoplay(fixed)", distinct versions to avoid hacky-workarounds.
 
It's always possible to click to play/pause,  and when previewed the right-click context menu has play/pause options as  well. 

To install, launch "Webm Quicklook.app" once, seeing the sample video indicates success. 
You can close the app.
Keep the app somewhere: the way QuickLook extensions function today is by fetching the plug-in each time from the app, this is Apple's rule, and it is so to ensure that mac plugin also go through Apple's app security review.
If you move it, launch it again.


To uninstall, delete the app.
