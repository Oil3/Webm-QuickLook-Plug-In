## Webm Quicklook plugin: play Webm movies in preview. Native, sandboxed, hardened MacOS app.


This is an initial version and all suggestions, comments, critics are welcome.

I aim to limit quantity/lines of code to the minimum required amount.

Known issues: Controls work perfectly but videos autoplay in the preview panel.
Wide videos in finder's preview panel refuse to be bound horizontally, and have to resize pannel or scroll within the panel.
I suspect the usual one-line-of-code fix would solve these.



Need to implement:

optional thumbnails (make the video capture first frame is the plan)

options, such as "mute on start" and "loop".

animated webP?
