**Download** from [Releases](https://github.com/Oil3/Webm-QuickLook-Plug-In/raw/refs/heads/main/Webm%20Quicklook%201.62%20universal%20binary.zip). 1.62 - properly fixed Finder panel autoplaying

If you need other video/audio formats, **try the beta 2.0** that quicklook-plays virtually _all non-natively-supported formats_ such as .mkv .wmv .flv .webm .rm, ... even .nuv.   
Instant playback even from network volumes, [Direct download Silicon beta](https://github.com/Oil3/Mkv-Quicklook/releases/download/1.32-MKV-cache-flush/QL-every-other-formats-BETA.zip)  [^1] . WebM experience is still much better on the normal WebM Quicklook 1.6.

## Install  
>Launch the app once. This registers the extension as the extension itself stays within the app bundle.  

## Uninstall  
>Delete the app.  

## Update  
>Replace the older app with the newer app.  MacOS looks for the extension in the app: if app is moved, a relaunch might be needed. 


Works on all macOSX versions (Monterey to latest Sequoia) and all Silicon or Intel mac architectures.

Once the app is launched, the WebM Quicklook extension appears in  `Extensions` from `General` in macOS' `System Settings`, and disapears if app is deleted.
