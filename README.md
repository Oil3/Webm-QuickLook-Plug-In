## Install  
>Launch the app once. This registers the extension as the extension itself stays within the app bundle.  

## Uninstall  
>Delete the app.  

## Update  
>Replace the older app with the newer app.  MacOS looks for the extension in the app: if app is moved, a relaunch might be needed.

Notarized and gatekeeper-approved.  


Once the app is launched, the WebM Quicklook extension appears in  `Extensions` from `General` in macOS' `System Settings`, and disapears if app is deleted.
