# Webm QuickLook Plug-In extension  
  

An extension for MacOS' "QuickLook" which allows .webm movies to be played in the Finder and Spotlight previews like any other movies.


To install, launch "Webm Quicklook.app" once.
Keep "Webm Quicklook.app" : the way QuickLook extensions function today is by being inside an app, it is because this way any plugin must pass Apple's app security checks.


To uninstall, delete the app.
