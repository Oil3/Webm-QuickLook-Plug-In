**Download** from [Releases](https://github.com/Oil3/Webm-QuickLook-Plug-In/releases/tag/1.62UniversalBinary). 1.62 - properly fixed Finder panel autoplaying. [*](#finder-panel)     

If you need other video/audio formats, **try QLCodec** that quicklook-plays virtually _all non-natively-supported formats_ such as .mkv .wmv .flv .webm .rm, .ivf, .ogg. wna ... even .nuv .   
Instant playback even from network volumes, [Repository](https://github.com/Oil3/QLCodec).

## Install  
>Launch the app once. This registers the extension as the extension itself stays within the app bundle.  

## Uninstall  
>Delete the app.  

## Update  
>Replace the older app with the newer app.  MacOS looks for the extension in the app: if app is moved, a relaunch might be needed. 


Works on all macOSX versions (Monterey to latest Sequoia) and all Silicon or Intel mac architectures.

## Tip
> `opt + space` quicklooks in full-screen

## Finder Panel  
Still unbeknownst why, on some machines, the finder panel refuses not to autoplay:  
if that is the case, a previous version with a different, simpler logic, prevents correctly this autoplay, at the tradeoff of not autoplaying the preceding video if you go back to it.   
It does keep the position of the preceding video and you can click once on the video, or click the play button, or right-click 'play' to resume playing.

##  

Once the app is launched, the WebM Quicklook extension appears in  `Extensions` from `General` in macOS' `System Settings`, and disapears if app is deleted.  
  
Notarized and gatekeeper-approved.

Light and fast.
