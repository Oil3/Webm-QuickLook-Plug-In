# Webm QuickLook Plug-In extension  
  

An extension for MacOS' "QuickLook" which allows .webm movies to be played in the Finder and Spotlight previews like any other movies.


To install, launch "Webm Quicklook.app" once.
Keep the app somewhere: the way QuickLook extensions function today is by being inside an app, it is because this ensures any mac plugin passes Apple's app security checks.


To uninstall, delete the app.
